  Welcome to my blog "How does IT matter?".
 </p>
 
 <br/>
 <p>
    
  IT management is a topic that has occupied the industry for over 60 years and is evolving and changing at a rapid pace, just like the technology that needs to be managed. This blog deals with the manifold tasks of an IT manager based on classical theorems of IT management paradigms like the Plan-Build-Run and management frameworks like the GRC matrix (- for Governance, Risk & Compliance) and tries to classify them according to their historicity, application and market relevance today.
